Several members are meeting to share some Noodles. I will be partaking in Sushi, though, as that is a gluten-free option.

I'm excited about this one, as I love Sushi and I like trying new places.

Many of the members planning to attend are remote developers. If you work remotely, be sure to get out of the house and meet some of your fellow hermits.

Kimura is downtown and Friday is the first day of PAX South 2019, which I know some of our members are attending.  I hope they also bring some interesting out of towners that they meet at the convention!
